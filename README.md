Automatic differentiation (also called algorithmic differentiation) is a set of techniques for calculating partial derivatives
of functions specified as computer programs. 
Since every program execution is always composed of a sequence of simple operations with known derivatives (arithmetics and mathematical functions like sin, exp, log, etc.),
the chain rule can be applied repeatedly to calculate partial derivatives automatically.
XAD implements this using operator-overloading in C++,
allowing to compute derivatives with minimal changes to the program.
See [automatic differentation mathematical background](https://auto-differentiation.github.io/aad/) for more details.

Application areas:

-   Machine Learning and Deep Learning: Training neural networks or other 
    machine learning models.
-   Optimization: Solving optimization problems in engineering and finance.
-   Numerical Analysis: Enhancing numerical solution methods for differential
    equations.
-   Scientific Computing: Simulating physical systems and processes.
-   Risk Management and Quantitative Finance: Assessing and hedging risk in
    financial models.
-   Computer Graphics: Optimizing rendering algorithms.
-   Robotics: Improving control and simulation of robotic systems.
-   Meteorology: Enhancing weather prediction models.
-   Biotechnology: Modeling biological processes and systems.

Key features:

-   Forward and adjoint mode for any order, using operator-overloading
-   Checkpointing support (for tape memory management)
-   External functions interface (to integrate external libraries)
-   Thread-safe tape
-   Formal exception-safety guarantees
-   High performance
-   Battle-tested in large production code bases

## Getting Started

XAD is a C++ library built with modern CMake and has no external dependencies. 
For instructions how to build and integrate it into your projects, please refer to the
[Installation Guide](https://auto-differentiation.github.io/installation/).

The documentation site also contains [tutorials](https://auto-differentiation.github.io/tutorials/), 
[examples](https://auto-differentiation.github.io/examples/), 
and information about [integrating XAD into QuantLib](https://auto-differentiation.github.io/quantlib/).

The sources for the site are located in the [docs](docs) directory in this repository.

## Getting Help

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the process of contributing to this project.
Please also obey our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all communication.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning,
making a new release available as soon as sufficient new features have been merged into `main`.
The final decision about a release and which features are included is with the project maintainers.
For the versions available, see the [releases in GitHub](https://github.com/auto-differentiation/XAD/releases).

Every new version is also added to the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md),
which needs to be maintained throughout the development.
That is, every pull request should also update the Changelog accordingly.
